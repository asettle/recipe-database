# Group Project

In this assignment, you are required to implement a dynamic web application for
the Recipe Web App, which will allow users to search for recipes, according to
various search criteria as discussed above. He would like the search functionality
to be as flexible as possible so that users can easily find suitable recipes.

The web app should be populated with reasonable sample data. You are required
to include at least 5 recipes from the following list from BBC Food:

1. Spaghetti Bolognese
2. Vegan Pancakes
3. Healthy Pizza
4. Easy Lamb Biryani
5. Couscous Salad
6. Plum clafoutis
7. Mango Pie
8. Mushroom Doner

The web app should use PHP and run on an Apache Web Server via XAMPP, using
the Visual Code as the development environment. You will also be required to
implement a MySQL database via MySQL Workbench containing representative sample
data for the purposes of testing your site and to connect to this MySQL database
from your server-side code.

The PHP application will be using version 7 or 8 of this language. The application
is required to present the application front-end user interface to the user using a
combination of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The user interface should be dynamically
generated using PHP web development techniques.

The web application will be assessed via Windows and a recent version of the Google
Chrome web browser. The client-side user interface should NOT utilise any front-end
web frameworks to render the HTML5 markup that comprises the content and structure
of the site. The site should be styled using CSS3 and work with both Mobile and
Desktop clients. JavaScript MUST be used for the client-side behaviour of your application.
